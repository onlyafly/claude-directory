# Find Code Smells

Find 3 code smells that could be fixed.

## Steps

1. Identify code smells. A code smell could be:
   - Large files that need refactoring
   - Areas with low test coverage
   - Duplicated/redundant systems
   - Legacy code
   - Dead code
   - Poorly-documented code
   - Files that are in the wrong place, or have misleading names, or need better
   - Debug cruft

## Notes

When looking for these smells, be creative and think outside the box.
